Model-based policy iteration in a grid-world using MATLAB

# MATLAB Policy Iteration Agent
This project implements a model-based policy iteration algorithm for an agent navigating a discretized 2D terrain to find the global minimum.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `RL_policy_iteration.m`: Core algorithm
- `terrain_shape.m`: 2D surface definition

## ðŸš€ Requirements
- MATLAB R2020+ (no extra toolbox required)

## ðŸ”§ Planned Improvements
- [x] Implementation of model-based policy iteration
- [ ] Visualization of the terrain and optimal policy using MATLAB plotting tools (e.g., `quiver`, `surf`, `contour`)
- [ ] Integration of a simple GUI for interactive exploration (optional)
- [ ] Animated demonstration of agent behavior over the terrain
